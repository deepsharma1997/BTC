# Brain Tumor Classifier - BTC
The python notebooks contain the code for multi-class brain tumor classification using several CNN archiectures.


# Brain Tumor Segmentation - BTS ( unet folder )
The scripts files in the unet folder contain multi-label brain tumor segmentation model using mulit-modality MRI data. The script files contain the pre-processing file for processing the raw MR images and register them to SRI24 anatomical atlas as mentioned in BRATs guidelines. Several models based on UNet architectures is used along wih different pre-processing techniques. 


# Reports
This section contain all the classification results from different CNN architectures for the categorization of brain tumor. The folder contain accuracy-loss graphs, confusion matrix, classification report on training/testing dataset.
